# GUDA Development Roadmap

## Milestone 1: Proof of Concept (Today)
**Goal**: Demonstrate parallel execution with CUDA-like API

Tasks:
- [ ] Basic device/context management
- [ ] Simple memory allocation
- [ ] Launch a kernel that adds two vectors
- [ ] Measure parallel speedup

Deliverable: `examples/vector_add.go` working

## Milestone 2: Core API (Week 1)
**Goal**: Implement essential CUDA runtime API

Tasks:
- [ ] Device enumeration and properties
- [ ] Memory management (malloc, free, memcpy)
- [ ] Kernel launch configuration
- [ ] Stream management
- [ ] Basic synchronization

Deliverable: Pass 5 basic CUDA examples

## Milestone 3: Compute Kernels (Week 2)
**Goal**: Support real computation

Tasks:
- [ ] Thread indexing (threadIdx, blockIdx, etc.)
- [ ] Shared memory
- [ ] Atomic operations
- [ ] Math functions
- [ ] Warp primitives (shuffle, vote)

Deliverable: Matrix multiplication working

## Milestone 4: Performance (Week 3)
**Goal**: Optimize for CPU execution

Tasks:
- [ ] SIMD operations where possible
- [ ] Cache-aware memory access
- [ ] Goroutine pool optimization
- [ ] Memory bandwidth optimization
- [ ] Profile and benchmark

Deliverable: 10+ GFLOPS on matrix multiply

## Milestone 5: Integration (Week 4)
**Goal**: Use with real applications

Tasks:
- [ ] Integration with menthar
- [ ] cuBLAS subset implementation
- [ ] Error handling and debugging
- [ ] Documentation
- [ ] Test suite

Deliverable: Run menthar inference with GUDA

## Decision Points

### NOW: Architecture Choice
1. **Pure Simulation**: Emulate GPU behavior exactly
2. **Hybrid Approach**: GPU-like API, CPU-optimized implementation ✓
3. **Transpiler**: Convert CUDA to optimized Go

### LATER: Kernel Format
1. Parse CUDA C/C++ kernels
2. Go function kernels with special markers
3. Both with runtime selection

### FUTURE: Backend Strategy
1. Start CPU-only, add GPU later ✓
2. Design for GPU from start
3. Plugin architecture for backends

## Quick Start Plan (Next 2 Hours)

1. Create basic structure
2. Implement device and context
3. Add memory allocation
4. Create kernel launch mechanism
5. Write vector addition example
6. Benchmark vs sequential

Ready to start with the basic structure?
