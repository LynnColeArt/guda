# FFU Integration Risk Assessment

## Strategic Risks

### 1. Scope Creep (HIGH)
**Risk**: FFU support could turn GUDA from a focused CUDA implementation into a generic heterogeneous runtime.

**Impact**: 
- Diluted focus on core CUDA compatibility
- Increased maintenance burden
- Potential performance regressions in core paths

**Mitigation**:
- Strict FFU criteria: Must provide >3x speedup to justify
- Feature flags to disable FFU entirely
- Maintain separate benchmark suite for core CUDA ops

### 2. Abstraction Overhead (MEDIUM)
**Risk**: The dispatch layer adds overhead that negates FFU benefits for small workloads.

**Impact**:
- Slower performance for small operations
- Increased complexity in kernel launch path
- Memory overhead for capability tracking

**Mitigation**:
- Compile-time specialization where possible
- Workload size thresholds (only use FFU for large ops)
- Caching of dispatch decisions

### 3. Platform Fragmentation (HIGH)
**Risk**: Different FFUs on different platforms lead to inconsistent behavior.

**Impact**:
- Results vary between platforms
- Testing complexity explosion
- Support burden increases

**Mitigation**:
- Strict numerical compatibility requirements
- Comprehensive fallback testing
- Platform-specific CI/CD pipelines

## Technical Risks

### 1. API Instability (MEDIUM)
**Risk**: FFU APIs (AMX, DirectML, etc.) are still evolving.

**Impact**:
- Breaking changes in dependencies
- Need to support multiple API versions
- Potential security issues

**Mitigation**:
- Version detection and compatibility layers
- Vendor-neutral abstraction layer
- Regular security audits

### 2. Data Movement Overhead (HIGH)
**Risk**: Moving data to/from FFUs negates performance benefits.

**Impact**:
- Worse performance than CPU-only
- Complex memory management
- Increased power consumption

**Mitigation**:
- Careful workload analysis
- Pipelining and prefetching
- Unified memory where possible

### 3. Debugging Complexity (HIGH)
**Risk**: FFU errors are hard to debug and reproduce.

**Impact**:
- Increased support burden
- Longer development cycles
- User frustration

**Mitigation**:
- Comprehensive logging
- FFU simulation mode for testing
- Clear error messages with fallback hints

## Operational Risks

### 1. Testing Resources (MEDIUM)
**Risk**: Need hardware with various FFUs for testing.

**Impact**:
- Incomplete test coverage
- Bugs slip through to production
- CI/CD costs increase

**Mitigation**:
- Cloud-based testing infrastructure
- Community testing program
- Simulation/emulation for basic tests

### 2. Documentation Burden (LOW)
**Risk**: FFU complexity requires extensive documentation.

**Impact**:
- User confusion
- Increased support requests
- Adoption barriers

**Mitigation**:
- Auto-generated capability docs
- Clear examples for each FFU
- Decision flowcharts

### 3. Maintenance Long-tail (HIGH)
**Risk**: Supporting many FFUs creates ongoing maintenance.

**Impact**:
- Technical debt accumulation
- Resource drain
- Feature velocity decrease

**Mitigation**:
- Sunset policy for underused FFUs
- Community maintainers for specific FFUs
- Automated compatibility testing

## Quantified Risk Matrix

| Risk | Probability | Impact | Score | Priority |
|------|------------|--------|-------|----------|
| Scope Creep | High (0.8) | High (0.9) | 0.72 | 1 |
| Data Movement | High (0.7) | High (0.8) | 0.56 | 2 |
| Platform Fragment | Med (0.6) | High (0.9) | 0.54 | 3 |
| Debug Complexity | High (0.7) | Med (0.6) | 0.42 | 4 |
| Maintenance | Med (0.5) | High (0.8) | 0.40 | 5 |

## Go/No-Go Criteria

### GO if:
- [x] AES-NI POC shows >5x speedup
- [ ] Dispatch overhead <1% for non-FFU paths
- [ ] Community enthusiasm (>10 contributors interested)
- [ ] Clear funding/resource commitment

### NO-GO if:
- [ ] Core GUDA performance regresses >2%
- [ ] Cannot achieve platform consistency
- [ ] Legal concerns with FFU APIs
- [ ] Team bandwidth insufficient

## Recommendation

**Proceed with CAUTION**: 
1. Start with AES-NI POC only
2. Measure everything
3. Get community feedback early
4. Be ready to pivot or abandon

The vision is compelling but the risks are real. We should validate core assumptions before full commitment.
