# Overcoming the Memory Wall: Techniques for Enhancing CPU Competitiveness in High-Throughput Workloads

## Abstract

Modern multi-core CPUs possess substantial computational capability, with high-end server processors (e.g., 32-core Xeon or EPYC) capable of sustaining 1–2 TFLOPS under optimal conditions. However, practical performance is often constrained not by compute capacity but by the limitations of memory bandwidth—an issue commonly referred to as the *memory wall*. This document outlines a set of algorithmic and architectural strategies designed to mitigate memory bandwidth bottlenecks in order to achieve GPU-comparable throughput on CPU platforms.

## 1. Problem Context

For workloads such as deep learning inference, the cost of repeatedly transferring intermediate results between CPU caches and main memory can dominate runtime. In a typical transformer layer, multiple sequential operations are performed, each requiring large memory reads/writes.

**Example:**
Given `seq_len = 512` and `d_model = 768`:

* Six sequential operations require:

  $$
  6 \times 512 \times 768 \times 4 \ \text{bytes} \approx 9.4 \ \text{MB}
  $$

* At 100 GB/s memory bandwidth, this equates to \~94 μs of data transfer time versus \~2 μs of computation time at 1 TFLOP, resulting in \~97% of the time spent on memory access.

## 2. Proposed Approach

By fusing operations and employing aggressive tiling, memory traffic can be reduced to approximately:

$$
1.5 \times \text{seq\_len} \times \text{d\_model} \times 4 \ \text{bytes}
$$

In the above example, this results in \~2.4 MB per layer (\~24 μs transfer time), yielding an estimated 4× performance improvement from memory efficiency alone.

## 3. Key Techniques

### 3.1 Cache-Oblivious Algorithms

Recursive subdivision avoids hard-coding tile sizes, enabling near-optimal utilization across varying cache hierarchies without architecture-specific tuning.

### 3.2 Increased Arithmetic Intensity

Operator fusion, particularly in transformer QKV projections, increases the ratio of floating-point operations to memory accesses, improving computational utilization.

### 3.3 CPU-Specific Memory Optimizations

* **Huge Pages:** Reduce TLB miss rates via larger memory pages (2 MB/1 GB), decreasing translation overhead.
* **NUMA Replication:** Place read-only data locally on each NUMA node to double effective bandwidth.
* **Streaming Loads/Stores:** Employ non-temporal memory accesses to avoid unnecessary cache pollution.

### 3.4 Layer-Level Fusion

Extend operator fusion beyond single operations to encompass entire model layers, maintaining intermediate data in cache across multiple processing stages.

### 3.5 Adaptive Parallelism

Dynamically adjust thread counts based on measured bandwidth per core to exploit CPU frequency scaling for memory-bound phases.

## 4. Performance Implications

Cumulative gains from these techniques can yield:

* \~4× from fusion and tiling
* \~2× from NUMA-aware data placement
* \~1.5× from improved prefetching
* \~2× from reduced precision (INT8/FP16) where applicable

When combined, these optimizations can achieve \~10–20× speedup over naive CPU implementations, allowing sustained throughput of 200–400 GFLOPS on 32-core CPUs—comparable to certain older GPU architectures.

## 5. Future Work

Planned next steps include:

1. Implementing AVX-512-optimized fused QKV projections
2. Designing a cache-oblivious attention mechanism
3. Measuring and optimizing memory bandwidth utilization
4. Profiling with tools such as Intel VTune to verify cache residency
5. Testing across multiple CPU architectures (Intel, AMD, ARM)

## Conclusion

The “memory wall” is not an insurmountable barrier. With CPU-specific algorithmic restructuring, careful cache management, and precision-appropriate computation, CPU performance in high-throughput workloads can approach that of older GPU systems while retaining the flexibility inherent to general-purpose processors.
