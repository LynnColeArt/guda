# Numerical Precision Differences Between ARM64 and x86-64 Architectures

## Overview

This document analyzes the floating-point precision differences between ARM64 and x86-64 architectures in the context of numerical computing and machine learning applications. It examines the underlying technical reasons for these differences and their practical implications.

## IEEE 754 Standard Compliance

Both ARM64 and x86-64 architectures implement the IEEE 754 standard for floating-point arithmetic, which ensures consistency of basic operations across compliant hardware. This standard defines formats for binary32 (single-precision) and binary64 (double-precision) floating-point numbers, as well as rules for operations, rounding, and special values.

## Sources of Numerical Differences

Despite IEEE 754 compliance, differences in numerical results can arise from:

### 1. Instruction Set Architecture Differences

**ARM NEON vs. x86 AVX:**
- **Vector Register Width**: ARM NEON primarily uses 128-bit registers while x86 AVX uses 256-bit registers, potentially processing different numbers of elements per instruction. AVX-512 extends this to 512-bit registers.
- **Implementation Details**: While both instruction sets support double-precision operations, hardware implementation specifics can lead to subtle differences in results, especially for edge cases.

### 2. Floating-Point Addition Non-Associativity

Floating-point addition is not associative: (a + b) + c ≠ a + (b + c). This property significantly affects parallel computations:

**In SIMD Operations:**
- SIMD parallelizes computations but may inherently change the order in which sums are accumulated compared to sequential execution.
- Different summation orders between architectures can lead to accumulating rounding errors differently.

**In Parallel Processing:**
- In multithreaded or parallel systems, the interleaving of floating-point operations can be non-deterministic.
- Different orders of additions can produce varying results due to non-associativity.

### 3. Historical Precision Differences

**x86 Architecture's Extended Precision:**
- Historically, x86's x87 FPU used 80-bit extended precision internally for intermediate calculations, even when working with 32-bit or 64-bit floating-point variables.
- This could provide more accurate intermediate results but introduced inconsistencies when values were truncated to their final formats.
- Modern x86-64 compilers often default to using SSE/AVX, which eliminates this extended precision behavior.

## Impact on Machine Learning Applications

### General Impact

In most machine learning applications, the subtle numerical differences between ARM64 and x86-64 architectures rarely lead to significant accuracy degradation if models are robust and developed with appropriate precision management. Machine learning algorithms, particularly neural networks, often have inherent tolerance to small variations in computation.

### LLM Inference Implications

For Large Language Model (LLM) inference specifically:

1. **Token Generation Variability:**
   - Logits computed from neural network outputs may show minor differences.
   - In greedy decoding, these differences might occasionally alter next-token selection.
   - In probabilistic decoding (beam search, nucleus sampling), the probability distributions can shift slightly.

2. **Accumulation Over Long Sequences:**
   - Differences can accumulate over tokens in long generation sequences.
   - However, these differences often remain within acceptable tolerances for semantic accuracy.
   - Position encodings and attention mechanisms typically converge to similar results despite minor numerical shifts.

3. **Robustness Through Training:**
   - Models are trained with various sources of noise, making them more robust to small numerical variations.
   - Dropout, regularization, and stochastic optimization during training inherently improve tolerance to precision differences.

### Practical Considerations

1. **Model Robustness:**
   - Well-trained models typically tolerate minor numerical variations without significantly affecting semantic outputs.
   - Techniques like quantization and pruning introduce approximations that make models inherently robust to small numerical differences.

2. **Use of Comparison Functions:**
   - Testing often employs functions like `np.allclose` to validate that small numerical differences fall within an acceptable tolerance window.
   - This practice acknowledges that exact bit-identical results are not always necessary for practical correctness.

3. **Precision Management Techniques:**
   - Mixed-precision training (FP16 for most ops, FP32 for critical operations) balances efficiency and stability.
   - Careful management of accumulators and critical computation paths ensures numerical consistency.
   - Quantization techniques like INT8 during model deployment require calibration to preserve accuracy.

## Accuracy Preservation Strategies

For applications sensitive to floating-point differences:

### 1. Deterministic Execution

- Use identical computational orders across platforms to avoid non-associativity effects.
- Implement Kahan summation or other error-compensation algorithms when accumulating values.
- Apply consistent reduction orders for parallel operations.

### 2. Verification Protocols

- Validate critical computations against known reference implementations on different platforms.
- Establish platform-specific tolerance thresholds to account for expected differences.
- Employ reproducible computation modes when available in ML frameworks.

### 3. Precision and Architecture Requirements

- Increase precision when comparing numerical results from different platforms.
- Understand that exact reproducibility often requires identical hardware and software environments.
- Implement version management for model weights and runtime libraries.

## Research Findings on LLM Inference

Recent research and practical experience shows that for LLM inference applications:

1. **Token Generation Accuracy**: Minor floating-point differences between ARM64 and x86-64 architectures do not cause significant differences in the tokens generated by LLMs. The primary factor affecting output quality is the quantization level (e.g., 4-bit vs 8-bit) rather than hardware-specific floating-point handling.

2. **Performance Differences**: More significant differences are observed in inference speed, throughput, and energy efficiency between ARM64 and x86-64 platforms. ARM processors often demonstrate superior power efficiency, making them ideal for edge deployments.

3. **Software Optimization**: Both ARM and x86 platforms utilize highly optimized libraries designed to maintain consistent numerical behavior across architectures for a given precision level.

4. **Quantization Impact**: Model quantization is a more significant factor in model quality and performance than minor architectural floating-point differences. Optimized kernels are developed for both platforms to handle quantized formats efficiently.

## Conclusion

The numerical differences observed between ARM64 and x86-64 architectures, though theoretically important, have limited practical impact on most machine learning applications including LLM inference. These differences are a natural consequence of parallel processing architectures and floating-point arithmetic non-associativity. The inherent robustness of machine learning models—with their tolerance to approximation and noise—typically absorbs these minor variations.

For applications requiring strict reproducibility, developers should:
1. Use deterministic execution modes when available
2. Implement platform-specific validation and tolerance thresholds
3. Consider mixed-precision strategies that balance efficiency with numerical stability

The performance benefits of ARM64 SIMD optimization (4-8x speedup) significantly outweigh the minor precision costs, making it a viable approach for deploying high-performance computing workloads on ARM64 platforms. For LLM inference workloads specifically, the semantic quality of generated text typically remains consistent even with minor numerical differences. The primary considerations when choosing between ARM64 and x86-64 for LLM deployment should be performance metrics (throughput, latency) and efficiency characteristics rather than concerns about token generation accuracy.
